It is used preoperatively to sedate the patient and allay apprehension, facilitate anesthesia induction and reduce anesthetic dosage. It is likewise effective in the control of postoperative pain. <newline> The use of morphine for the relief of pain should be reserved for the more severe manifestations of pain, as in myocardial infarction, severe injuries, or in severe chronic pain associated with terminal cancer after all non-narcotic analgesics have failed. <newline> Effective analgesic therapy of severe chronic pain associated with terminal cancer continues to be a difficult problem. Intermittent administration of intramuscular morphine may be effective; however, the mode of therapy has significant limitations. Morphine has a short plasma half-life of 2.5 to 3.0 hours; therefore, frequent administration (every 1 to 2 hours) often becomes necessary to control severe pain associated with cancer. Tolerance develops to the analgesic effects and increasingly higher doses of morphine are required to produce analgesia. The higher morphine doses produce significant and often life-threatening side effects (see \"ADVERSE REACTIONS\"). The peak and trough effects produced by intermittent administration cause fluctuations in pain control. Repeated I.M. injections are frequently unacceptable due to the lack of muscle mass in the debilitated patient, the tendency for bruising and bleeding at the injection site, and the anxiety and pain associated with the injection. <newline> Continuous I.V. infusion of morphine (see \"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\") has been employed as an alternative to the traditional modes of administration. Lower doses of morphine produce uniform pain control because a steady morphine concentration is maintained. Titration of the dosage to the patient 's needs is easily achieved by adjusting the infusion rate. The lag time between the patient's request for pain medication and administration of the dose and the amount of nursing time necessary for preparation and administration of frequent doses are reduced. The degree of respiratory depression and sedation may be decreased, and the anxiety experienced by the patient in anticipation of I.M. administration is avoided.

A manic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Typical symptoms of mania include pressure of speech, motor hyperactivity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas, grandiosity, poor judgment, aggressiveness, and possible hostility. <newline> The efficacy of Depakote was established in 3-week trials with patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for bipolar disorder who were hospitalized for acute mania [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . <newline> The safety and effectiveness of Depakote for long-term use in mania, i.e., more than 3 weeks, has not been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials.

These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including thiazide-like diuretics such as chlorthalidone and ARBs such as azilsartan medoxomil. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with Edarbyclor. <newline> Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management of high blood pressure, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). <newline> Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. <newline> Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. <newline> Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients; however, the blood pressure effect of Edarbyclor in blacks is similar to that in non-blacks. Many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. <newline> The choice of Edarbyclor as initial therapy for hypertension should be based on an assessment of potential benefits and risks including whether the patient is likely to tolerate the starting dose of Edarbyclor. <newline> Patients with moderate-to-severe hypertension are at a relatively high risk of cardiovascular events (e.g., stroke, heart attack, and heart failure), kidney failure, and vision problems, so prompt treatment is clinically relevant. Consider the patient's baseline blood pressure, target goal and the incremental likelihood of achieving the goal with a combination product, such as Edarbyclor, versus a monotherapy product when deciding upon initial therapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based on the patient's risk. <newline> Data from an 8-week, active-controlled, factorial trial provide estimates of the probability of reaching a target blood pressure with Edarbyclor compared with azilsartan medoxomil or chlorthalidone monotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . <newline> Figures 1.a-1.d provide estimates of the likelihood of achieving target clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure control with Edarbyclor 40/25 mg tablets after 8 weeks, based on baseline systolic or diastolic blood pressure.

The likelihood of achieving these same goals on chlorthalidone 25 mg is approximately 51% (systolic) and 40% (diastolic).

The results of a randomized, double-blind trial comparing MEPRON to TMP-SMX in AIDS patients with mild-to-moderate PCP (defined in the study protocol as an alveolar-arterial oxygen diffusion gradient [(A-a )DO ] \u226445 mm Hg and PaO \u226560 mm Hg on room air) and a randomized trial comparing MEPRON to IV pentamidine isethionate in patients with mild-to-moderate PCP intolerant to trimethoprim or sulfa-antimicrobials are summarized below: <newline> TMP-SMX Comparative Study <newline> This double-blind, randomized trial initiated in 1990 was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of MEPRON to that of TMP-SMX for the treatment of AIDS patients with histologically confirmed PCP. Only patients with mild-to-moderate PCP were eligible for enrollment. <newline> A total of 408 patients were enrolled into the trial at 37 study centers. Eighty-six patients without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses. Of the 322 patients with histologically confirmed PCP, 160 were randomized to receive MEPRON and 162 to TMP-SMX. <newline> Study participants randomized to treatment with MEPRON were to receive 750 mg MEPRON (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days and those randomized to TMP-SMX were to receive 320 mg TMP plus 1,600 mg SMX 3 times daily for 21 days. <newline> Therapy success was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy. Therapy failures included lack of response, treatment discontinuation due to an adverse experience, and unevaluable. <newline> There was a significant difference ( P = 0.03) in mortality rates between the treatment groups. Among the 322 patients with confirmed PCP, 13 of 160 (8%) patients treated with MEPRON and 4 of 162 (2.5%) patients receiving TMP-SMX died during the 21-day treatment course or 8-week follow-up period. In the intent-to-treat analysis for all 408 randomized patients, there were 16 (8%) deaths in the arm treated with MEPRON and 7 (3.4%) deaths in the TMP-SMX arm ( P = 0.051). Of the 13 patients treated with MEPRON who died, 4 died of PCP and 5 died with a combination of bacterial infections and PCP; bacterial infections did not appear to be a factor in any of the 4 deaths among TMP-SMX-treated patients. <newline> A correlation between plasma atovaquone concentrations and death was demonstrated; in general, patients with lower plasma concentrations were more likely to die. For those patients for whom day 4 plasma atovaquone concentration data are available, 5 (63%) of the 8 patients with concentrations <5 mcg/mL died during participation in the study. However, only 1 (2.0%) of the 49 patients with day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations \u22655 mcg/mL died. <newline> Sixty-two percent of patients on MEPRON and 64% of patients on TMP-SMX were classified as protocol-defined therapy successes (Table 4). <newline> Table 4.

Approximately 80% of the patients either had a history of intolerance to trimethoprim or sulfa-antimicrobials (the primary therapy group) or were experiencing intolerance to TMP-SMX with treatment of an episode of PCP at the time of enrollment in the study (the salvage treatment group). <newline> Patients randomized to MEPRON were to receive 750 mg atovaquone (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days and those randomized to pentamidine isethionate were to receive a 3- to 4-mg/kg single IV infusion daily for 21 days. <newline> A total of 174 patients were enrolled into the trial at 22 study centers. Thirty-nine patients without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses. Of the 135 patients with histologically confirmed PCP, 70 were randomized to receive MEPRON and 65 to pentamidine. One hundred and ten (110) of these were in the primary therapy group and 25 were in the salvage therapy group. One patient in the primary therapy group randomized to receive pentamidine did not receive study medication. <newline> There was no difference in mortality rates between the treatment groups. Among the 135 patients with confirmed PCP, 10 of 70 (14%) patients randomized to MEPRON and 9 of 65 (14%) patients randomized to pentamidine died during the 21-day treatment course or 8-week follow-up period. In the intent-to-treat analysis for all randomized patients, there were 11 (12.5%) deaths in the arm treated with MEPRON and 12 (14%) deaths in the pentamidine arm. For those patients for whom day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations are available, 3 of 5 (60%) patients with concentrations <5 mcg/mL died during participation in the study. However, only 2 of 21 (9%) patients with day 4 plasma concentrations \u22655 mcg/mL died. <newline> The therapeutic outcomes for the 134 patients who received study medication in this trial are presented in Table 5. <newline> Table 5.

Prior to initiating therapy with nicotinic acid, secondary causes for hypercholesterolemia (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other drug therapy, alcoholism) should be excluded, and a lipid profile performed to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. <newline> II.

Whether FANAPT will cause torsade de pointes or increase the rate of sudden death is not yet known. <newline> Patients must be titrated to an effective dose of FANAPT. Thus, control of symptoms may be delayed during the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment compared to some other antipsychotic drugs that do not require a similar titration. Prescribers should be mindful of this delay when selecting an antipsychotic drug for the treatment of schizophrenia [ s ee Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14)] . <newline> The effectiveness of FANAPT in long-term use, that is, for more than 6 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials.

( 1 ) Efficacy was established in two short-term (4- and 6-week) placebo- and active-controlled studies of adult patients with schizophrenia.

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with torsemide. <newline> Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). <newline> Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. <newline> Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. <newline> The antihypertensive effects of torsemide tablets are on the average greater in black patients than in nonblack patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] .

These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug. <newline> Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). <newline> Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. <newline> Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. <newline> Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease).

Exposure to the feared situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, which may approach the intensity of a panic attack. The feared situations are avoided or endured with intense anxiety or distress. The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is a marked distress about having the phobias.

In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. <newline> LEVAQUIN Tablets/Injection and Oral Solution are indicated for the treatment of adults (\u226518 years of age) with mild, moderate, and severe infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed in this section. LEVAQUIN Injection is indicated when intravenous administration offers a route of administration advantageous to the patient (e.g., patient cannot tolerate an oral dosage form). <newline> LEVAQUIN is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial indicated in adults ( \u226518 years of age) with infections caused by designated, susceptible bacteria ( 1 , 12.4 ). <newline> <bullet> Pneumonia: nosocomial ( 1.1 ) and community acquired ( 1.2 , 1.3 ) <newline> <bullet> Acute bacterial sinusitis ( 1.4 ) <newline> <bullet> Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis ( 1.5 ) <newline> <bullet> Skin and skin structure infections: complicated ( 1.6 ) and uncomplicated ( 1.7 ) <newline> <bullet> Chronic bacterial prostatitis ( 1.8 ) <newline> <bullet> Urinary tract infections: complicated ( 1.9 , 1.10 ) and uncomplicated ( 1.12 ) <newline> <bullet> Acute pyelonephritis ( 1.11 ) <newline> <bullet> Inhalational anthrax, post-exposure ( 1.13 ).

Single-drug treatment of active tuberculos with isoniazid, or any other medication, is inadequate therapy. <newline> Isoniazid is recommended as preventive therapy for the following groups, regardless of age. (Note: the criterion for a positive reaction to a skin test (in millimeters of induration) for each group is given in parenthesis): <newline> 1. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (\u2265 5 mm) and persons with risk <newline> factors for HIV infection whose HIV infection status is unknown but who are suspected of <newline> having HIV infection. <newline> Preventive therapy may be considered for HIV infected persons who are tuberculin- negative <newline> but belong to groups in which the prevalence of tuberculosis infection is high. Candidates for <newline> preventive therapy who have HIV infection should have a minimum of 12 months of therapy. <newline> 2. Close contacts of persons with newly diagnosed infectious tuberculosis (\u2265 5 mm). In addition, <newline> tuberculin-negative (< 5mm) children and adolescents who have been close contacts of in- <newline> fectious persons within the past 3 months are candidates for preventive therapy until a repeat <newline> tuberculin skin test is done 12 weeks after contact with the infectious source. If the repeat skin <newline> test is positive (> 5 mm), therapy should be continued. <newline> 3. Recent converters, as indicated by a tuberculin skin test (\u2265 10 mm increase within a 2-year <newline> period for those < 35 years old; \u2265 15 mm increase for those \u2265 35 years of age). All infants and <newline> children younger than 4 years of age with a > 10 mm skin test are included in this category. <newline> 4. Persons with abnormal chest radiographs that show fibrotic lesions likely to represent old <newline> healed tuberculosis (\u2265 5 mm). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary <newline> lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 <newline> months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly. <newline> 5. Intravenous drug users known to be HIV-seronegative (> 10 mm). <newline> 6. Persons with the following medical conditions that have been reported to increase the risk of <newline> tuberculosis (\u2265 10 mm): silicosis; diabetes mellitus; prolonged therapy with adrenocorti- <newline> costeroids; immunosuppressive therapy; some hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, <newline> such as leukemia or Hodgkin's disease; end-stage renal disease; clinical situations associated <newline> with substantial rapid weight loss or chronic under nutrition (including: intestinal bypass <newline> surgery for obesity, the postgastrectomy state (with or without weight loss), chronic peptic <newline> ulcer disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes, and carcinomas of the oropharynx and upper <newline> gastrointestinal tract that prevent adequate nutritional intake). Candidates for preventive <newline> therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have <newline> pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and <newline> rifampin, concomitantly. <newline> Additionally, in the absence of any of the above risk factors, persons under the age of 35 with a tuberculin skin test reaction of 10 mm or more are also appropriate candidates for preventive therapy if they are a member of any of the following high-incidence groups: <newline> <bullet> Foreign-born persons from high-prevalence countries who never received BCG vaccine. <newline> <bullet> Medically under served low-income populations, including high-risk racial or ethnic minority populations, especially blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. <newline> <bullet> Residents of facilities for long-term care (e.g., correctional institutions, nursing homes, and mental institutions). <newline> Children who are less than 4 years old are candidates for isoniazid preventive therapy if they have > 10 mm induration from a PPD Mantoux tuberculin skin test. <newline> Finally, persons under the age of 35 who a) have none of the above risk factors (1-6); b) belong to none of the high-incidence groups; and c) have a tuberculin skin test reaction of 15 mm or more, are appropriate candidates for preventive therapy. <newline> The risk of hepatitis must be weighed against the risk of tuberculosis in positive tuberculin reactors over the age of 35. However, the use of isoniazid is recommended for those with the additional risk factors listed above (1-6) and on an individual basis insituations where there is likelihood of serious consequences to contacts who may become infected. <newline> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (See also INDICATIONS0.) <newline> <bullet> <newline> NOTE -- For preventive therapy of tuberculous infection and treatment of tuberculosis, it is recommended that physicians be familiar with the following publications: (1) the recommen- dations of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, published in the MMWR: vol 42; RR-4, 1993 and (2) Treatment of Tuberculosis and Tuberculosis Infection in Adults and Children, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine: vol 149; 1359-1374, 1994. <newline> For Treatment of Tuberculosis <newline> Isoniazid is used in conjunction with other effective anti-tuberculosis agents. Drug susceptibility testing should be performed on the organisms initially isolated from all patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis. If the bacilli becomes resistant, therapy must be changed to agents to which the bacilli are susceptible. <newline> Usual Oral Dosage (depending on the regimen used): <newline> Adults: 5 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 15 mg/kg up to 900 mg/day, two or <newline> three times/week <newline> Children: 10 - 15 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 20-40 mg/kg up to 900 <newline> mg/day, two or three times/week <newline> Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis Without HIV Infection <newline> There are 3 regimen options for the initial treatment of tuberculosis in children and adults: <newline> Option 1: Daily isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 8 weeks followed by 16 weeks of <newline> isoniazid and rifampin daily or 2 to 3 times weekly. Ethambutol or streptomycin <newline> should be added to the initial regimen until sensitivity to isoniazid and rifampin is <newline> demonstrated. The addition of a fourth drug is optional if the relative prevalence of <newline> isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the community is less <newline> than or equal to four percent. <newline> Option 2: Daily isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin or ethambutol for 2 <newline> weeks followed by twice weekly administration of the same drugs for 6 weeks, <newline> subsequently twice weekly isoniazid and rifampin for 16 weeks. <newline> Option 3: Three times weekly with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or <newline> streptomycin for 6 months. <newline> * All regimen given twice weekly or 3 times weekly should be administered by directly observed therapy (see also Directly Observed Therapy ). <newline> The above treatment guidelines apply only when the disease is caused by organisms that are sus- ceptible to the standard antituberculous agents. Because of the impact of resistance to isoniazid and rifampin on the response to therapy, it is essential that physicians initiating therapy for tu- berculosis be familiar with the prevalence of drug resistance in their communities. It is suggested that ethambutol not be used in children whose visual acuity cannot be monitored. <newline> Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis and HIV Infection <newline> The response of the immunologically impaired host to treatment may not be as satisfactory as that of a person with normal host responsiveness. For this reason, therapeutic decisions for the impaired host must be individualized. Since patients co-infected with HIV may have problems with malabsorption, screening of antimycobacterial drug levels, especially in patients with ad- vanced HIV disease, may be necessary to prevent the emergence of MDRTB. <newline> Patients with Extra Pulmonary Tuberculosis <newline> The basic principles that underlie the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis also apply to Extra pulmonary forms of the disease. Although there have not been the same kinds of carefully conducted controlled trials of treatment of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis as for pulmonary disease, increasing clinical experience indicates that a 6 to 9 month short-course regimen is effective. Because of the insufficient data, military tuberculosis, bone/joint tuberculosis, and tuberculous meningitis in infants and children should receive 12 month therapy. <newline> Bacteriologic evaluation of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis may be limited by the relative in accessibility of the sites of disease. Thus, response to treatment often must be judged on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings. <newline> The use of adjunctive therapies such as surgery and corticosteroids is more commonly required in Extra pulmonary tuberculosis than in pulmonary disease. Surgery may be necessary to obtain specimens for diagnosis and to treat such processes as constrictive pericarditis and spinal cord compression from Pott's Disease. Corticosteroids have been shown to be of benefit in preventing cardiac constriction from tuberculous pericarditis and in decreasing the neurologic sequelae of all stages of tuberculosis meningitis, especially when administered early in the course of the disease. <newline> Pregnant Women with Tuberculosis <newline> The options listed above must be adjusted for the pregnant patient. Streptomycin interferes with in utero development of the ear and may cause congenital deafness. Routine use of pyrazinamide is also not recommended in pregnancy because of inadequate teratogenicity data. The initial treatment regimen should consist of isoniazid and rifampin. Ethambutol should be included unless primary isoniazid resistance is unlikely (isoniazid resistance rate documented to be less than 4%). <newline> Treatment of Patients with Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB) <newline> Multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis (i.e., resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin) presents difficult treatment problems. Treatment must be individualized and based on susceptibility studies. In such cases, consultation with an expert in tuberculosis is recommended. <newline> Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) <newline> A major cause of drug-resistant tuberculosis is patient noncompliance with treatment. The use of DOT can help assure patient compliance with drug therapy. DOT is the observation of the pa- tient by a health care provider or other responsible person as the patient ingests anti-tuberculosis medications. DOT can be achieved with daily, twice weekly or thrice weekly regimens, and is recommended for all patients. <newline> For Preventative Therapy of Tuberculosis <newline> Before isoniazid preventive therapy is initiated, bacteriologically positive or radiographically progressive tuberculosis must be excluded. Appropriate evaluations should be performed if Extra pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected. <newline> Adults over 30 Kg: 300 mg per day in a single dose. <newline> Infants and Children: 10 mg/kg (up to 300 mg daily) in a single dose. In situations where adherence with daily preventative therapy cannot be assured, 20-30 mg/kg (not to exceed 900 mg) twice weekly under the direct observation of a health care worker at the time of admin- istration . <newline> Continuous administration of isoniazid for a sufficient period is an essential part of the regimen because relapse rates are higher if chemotherapy is stopped prematurely. In the treatment of tu- berculosis, resistant organisms may multiply and the emergence of resistant organisms during the treatment may necessitate a change in the regimen. <newline> For following patient compliance: the Potts-Cozart test , a simple colorimetric method of checking for isoniazid in the urine, is a useful tool for assuring patient compliance, which is essential for effective tuberculosis control. Additionally, isoniazid test strips are also available <newline> to check patient compliance. <newline> Concomitant administration of pyridoxine (B ) is recommended in malnourished and in those predisposed to neuropathy (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics).", ["ACTIVE TUBERCULOSIS", "TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION", "TUBERCULOSIS"]], ["92cdf763-8aea-4f3a-be05-e515f3cd4317", "INDICATIONS AND USAGE <newline> Levetiracetam is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures in adults and children 4 years of age and older with epilepsy.", ["SEIZURES", "EPILEPSY"]], ["05248b68-16a9-488d-a39f-5137d2410471", "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE <newline> MOXEZA solution is indicated for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis caused by susceptible strains of the following organisms: <newline> Aerococcus viridans* <newline> Corynebacterium macginleyi* <newline> Enterococcus faecalis * <newline> Micrococcus luteus* <newline> Staphylococcus arlettae * <newline> Staphylococcus aureus <newline> Staphylococcus capitis <newline> Staphylococcus epidermidis <newline> Staphylococcus haemolyticus <newline> Staphylococcus hominis <newline> Staphylococcus saprophyticus * <newline> Staphylococcus warneri* <newline> Streptococcus mitis* <newline> Streptococcus pneumoniae <newline> Streptococcus parasanguinis * <newline> Escherichia coli* <newline> Haemophilus influenza <newline> Klebsiella pneumoniae * <newline> Propionibacterium acnes <newline> Chlamydia trachomatis* <newline> * Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections. <newline> MOXEZA solution is a topical fluoroquinolone anti-infective indicated for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis caused by susceptible strains of the following organisms: <newline> Aerococcus viridans*, Corynebacterium macginleyi *, Enterococcus faecalis*, Micrococcus luteus *, Staphylococcus arlettae *, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus *, Staphylococcus warneri*, Streptococcus mitis*, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus parasanguinis *, Escherichia coli*, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae *, Propionibacterium acnes, Chlamydia trachomatis * <newline> * Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections.

A major depressive episode implies a prominent and relatively persistent depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks); it should include at least 4 of the following 8 symptoms: Change in appetite, change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. <newline> The effects of paroxetine in hospitalized depressed patients have not been adequately studied. <newline> The efficacy of paroxetine in maintaining a response in major depressive disorder for up to 1 year was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use paroxetine for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. <newline> Obsessive Compulsive Disorder <newline> Paroxetine tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of obsessions and compulsions in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) as defined in the DSM-IV. The obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time-consuming, or significantly interfere with social or occupational functioning. <newline> The efficacy of paroxetine was established in two 12-week trials with obsessive compulsive outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-IIIR category of obsessive compulsive disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials ). <newline> Obsessive compulsive disorder is characterized by recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images (obsessions) that are ego-dystonic and/or repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors (compulsions) that are recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable. <newline> Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in a 6-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients assigned to paroxetine showed a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use paroxetine for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). <newline> Panic Disorder <newline> Paroxetine tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-IV. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks. <newline> The efficacy of paroxetine was established in three 10- to 12-week trials in panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IIIR category of panic disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials ). <newline> Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which 4 (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes. <newline> Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in a 3-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with panic disorder assigned to paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials ). Nevertheless, the physician who prescribes paroxetine for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). <newline> Generalized Anxiety Disorder <newline> Paroxetine tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), as defined in DSM-IV. Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic. <newline> The efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of GAD was established in two 8-week placebo-controlled trials in adults with GAD. Paroxetine has not been studied in children or adolescents with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials ). <newline> Generalized Anxiety Disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) that is persistent for at least 6 months and which the person finds difficult to control. It must be associated with at least 3 of the following 6 symptoms: Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance. <newline> The efficacy of paroxetine in maintaining a response in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, who responded during an 8-week acute treatment phase while taking paroxetine and were then observed for relapse during a period of up to 24 weeks, was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials ).

The physician who elects to use PAXIL CR for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. <newline> Panic Disorder <newline> PAXIL CR is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-IV. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks. <newline> The efficacy of PAXIL CR controlled-release tablets was established in two 10-week trials in panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IV category of panic disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Clinical Trials). <newline> Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which 4 (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes. <newline> Long-term maintenance of efficacy with the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine was demonstrated in a 3-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with panic disorder assigned to immediate-release paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Clinical Trials). Nevertheless, the physician who prescribes PAXIL CR for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. <newline> Social Anxiety Disorder <newline> PAXIL CR is indicated for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia, as defined in DSM-IV (300.23). Social anxiety disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of 1 or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. Exposure to the feared situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, which may approach the intensity of a panic attack. The feared situations are avoided or endured with intense anxiety or distress. The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is marked distress about having the phobias. Lesser degrees of performance anxiety or shyness generally do not require psychopharmacological treatment. <newline> The efficacy of PAXIL CR as a treatment for social anxiety disorder has been established, in part, on the basis of extrapolation from the established effectiveness of the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine. In addition, the efficacy of PAXIL CR was established in a 12-week trial, in adult outpatients with social anxiety disorder (DSM-IV). PAXIL CR has not been studied in children or adolescents with social phobia (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Clinical Trials). <newline> The effectiveness of PAXIL CR in long-term treatment of social anxiety disorder, i.e., for more than 12 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in adequate and well-controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to prescribe PAXIL CR for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). <newline> Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder <newline> PAXIL CR is indicated for the treatment of PMDD. <newline> The efficacy of PAXIL CR in the treatment of PMDD has been established in 3 placebo-controlled trials (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Clinical Trials). <newline> The essential features of PMDD, according to DSM-IV, include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating, and weight gain. These symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following the onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school or with usual social activities and relationships with others. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders that may be exacerbated by treatment with an antidepressant. <newline> The effectiveness of PAXIL CR in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 menstrual cycles, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials.

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the classes to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. <newline> <bullet> Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). <newline> <bullet> Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. <newline> <bullet> Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. <newline> <bullet> Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. <newline> Usage in Pregnancy <newline> The routine use of diuretics in an otherwise healthy woman is inappropriate and exposes mother and fetus to unnecessary hazard. Diuretics do not prevent development of toxemia of pregnancy, and there is no satisfactory evidence that they are useful in the treatment of developing toxemia. <newline> Edema during pregnancy may arise from pathologic causes or from the physiologic and mechanical consequences of pregnancy. Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated in pregnancy when edema is due to pathologic causes just as it is in the absence of pregnancy (however, see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Dependent edema in pregnancy, resulting from restriction of venous return by the expanded uterus, is properly treated through elevation of the lower extremities and use of support hose; use of diuretics to lower intravascular volume in this case is unsupported and unnecessary. There is hypervolemia during normal pregnancy which is not harmful to either the fetus or the mother (in the absence of cardiovascular disease), but which is associated with edema, including generalized edema, in the majority of pregnant women. If this edema produces discomfort, increased recumbency will often provide relief. In rare instances, this edema may cause extreme discomfort that is not relieved by rest. In these cases, a short course of diuretics may provide relief and may be appropriate.", ["CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE", "NEPHROTIC SYNDROME", "ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION"]], ["a519a201-bcfd-4029-9bdf-fc3e03f975ac", "INDICATIONS AND USAGE <newline> TREZIX (acetaminophen, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine bitartrate) capsules are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. <newline> Limitations of Use <newline> Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, with opioids, even at recommended doses [see WARNINGS ], reserve TREZIX for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics] <newline> <bullet> Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated, <newline> <bullet> Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia", ["SEVERE PAIN"]], ["9333c79b-d487-4538-a9f0-71b91a02b287", "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE <newline> KEYTRUDA is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking antibody indicated: <newline> Melanoma <newline> <bullet> for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
